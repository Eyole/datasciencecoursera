Read Me for running analysis of Samsung Data

Assumptions
1) run_analysis.R has been copied to the <Working Directory>
2) Test files are in <Working Directory> "/test/Inertial Signals/"
3) Train files are in <Working Directory> "/train/Inertial Signals/"

Running the code
Code can be run by sourcing run_analysis.R
or perhaps by running the function run_analysis() in run_analysis.R

The output file is df.single.tidy.dataset.txt which contains the averages for each subject (V1...) 
in both testing and training activties across the following variables. 
[Body X Acceleration]
[Body Y Acceleration]
[Body Z Acceleration]
[Body X Gyro]
[Body Y Gyro]
[Body Z Gyro]
[Total X Accelration]
[Total Y Acceleration]
[Total Z Acceleration]

Averages  and Standard Deviation for the listed variables in each activity (testing or training)
can be seen by calling the function 

CalcMeanAndSd()

The Mean and Sd for both Testing And Training are displayed but also the general mean and SD irrespective of the activity.
