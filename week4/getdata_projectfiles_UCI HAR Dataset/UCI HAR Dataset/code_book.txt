Explanation of the data fields.

Subjects
A string variable representing the reference number for the subject (V1 ... V99) in their Testing and Training activity 

Activity: 
Non-Coded categorical variable of two levels. It is recorded as a string, "Test" or "Train"

Average Body X Acc
This is a numeric variable representing the average of all "body_acc_x" 
measurements collected on the subject for an activity either Test or Train.

"Average Body Y Acc" 
This is a numeric variable representing the average of all "body_acc_y" 
measurements collected on the subject for an activity either Test or Train.

"Average Body Z Acc" 
This is a numeric variable representing the average of all "body_acc_z" 
measurements collected on the subject for an activity either Test or Train.

"Average Body X Gyro" 
This is a numeric variable representing the average of all "body_gyro_x" 
measurements collected on the subject for an activity either Test or Train.

"Average Body Y Gyro" 
This is a numeric variable representing the average of all "body_gyro_y" 
measurements collected on the subject for an activity either Test or Train.

"Average Body Z Gyro" 
This is a numeric variable representing the average of all "body_gyro_z" 
measurements collected on the subject for an activity either Test or Train.

"Average Total X Acc" 
This is a numeric variable representing the average of all "total_acc_x" 
measurements collected on the subject for an activity either Test or Train.

"Average Total Y Acc" 
This is a numeric variable representing the average of all "total_acc_y" 
measurements collected on the subject for an activity either Test or Train.

"Average Total Z Acc" 
This is a numeric variable representing the average of all "total_acc_z" 
measurements collected on the subject for an activity either Test or Train.
